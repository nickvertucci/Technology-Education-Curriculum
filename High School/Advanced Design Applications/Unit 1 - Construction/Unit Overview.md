# Unit 1 - construction

## The Big Idea
Construction techniques and processes vary with different settings.

#### Teacher's Note

Big ideas should be made explicit to students by writing them on the board, reading them aloud, and/or posting them on worksheets associated with the lessons. For deeper understanding, have students write the Big Idea in their own Engineering Design Journal (EDJ), using their own words if they choose.

## Enduring Understandings
The Construction Unit focuses on nine enduring understandings. Students will be able to:

- Recognize that technological progression is driven by a number of factors, including individual creativity, product and systems innovations, and human wants and needs.
- Understand that a technological development for the solution of a problem in one context, can spinoff for use in a variety of often unrelated applications.
- Recognize that technological change can be positive and/or negative and can have intended and/or unforeseen social, cultural, and environmental consequences.
- Design technological systems, the components of those systems, and how they fit into the larger technological, economic, and social systems.
- Identify and analyze compelling and controversial issues associated with the acquisition, development, use, and disposal of resources.
- Understand that the complexities of technological design involve trade-offs among competing constraints and requirements, including engineering, economic, political, social, and environmental considerations.
- Use technological design as a systematic process used to initiate and refine ideas, solve problems, and maintain products and systems.
- Analyze how technological assessment is used to determine the benefits, limitations, and risks associated with existing and proposed technologies.
- Use a variety of simple and complex technologies.  

## Purpose of Unit
The Construction unit is designed to give students a basic understanding of construction principles and conventions as they relate to Advanced Design Applications.
