### Course Description

This curriculum leverages the “coolness” of robotics, and the excitement of head to head competition to inspire and engage students.

Students will walk through the design and build a mobile robot to play a sport-like game.  During this process they will learn key STEM principles, and robotics concepts.  At the culmination of this class, they will compete head-to-head against their peers in the classroom, or on the world stage in the VEX Robotics Competition, the largest and fastest growing international robotics competition for middle and high school students.

This modular and project-based curriculum teaches the design process in an engaging, hands-on manner to help teachers challenge, motivate, and inspire their students.  By moving students through an actual engineering project, students quickly understand the relevance of what they are learning.

The curriculum is created to ensure that students with varying learning styles and levels can accomplish the lesson goals.  No prior robotics experience is required; beginners are able to advance sequentially through the units to gradually increase their knowledge and skill level.


### Course Requirements

Students are required to complete several drawing projects.  The quality and overall presentation of these projects will be used to determine the grade.  Particular attention to detail will be emphasized. Students will be required to accumulate skills from the beginning of the course and will be expected to build on their skills with each successive project. Each assignment will be evaluated based on:

| Category | Weight | 0 points  | 25 points | 50 points | 75 points | 100 points |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Organization | 20% | Unable to find assignments or not routinely saved | Able to demonstrate some organization by backing up files or use of folders | Both drawings and models are identifiable and can be found if needed | All drawings are in a folder and models organized by folders in Google Drive | All drawings are in a folder labeled correctly and models organized by folders in Google Drive labeled correctly |
| Class Participation | 20% | Showed no participation | Limited to no participation | Inconsistent day-to-day participation | Participated only when needed  | Engaged daily and actively participated |
| Effort | 30% | No effort | limited to no effort | Inconsistent day-to-day effort | Showed effort only when needed or routinely directed | Continuous day-to-day effort with or without direction |
| Creativity/Originality | 15% | No creativity, copied designs | Minimal creativity based off past designs | Moderate improvements based off past designs | Complete overhaul of past or found designs | Completely new idea/design |
| Craftsmanship/Skill | 15% | Poor execution, no planning | Moderate end result, able to achieve an outcome | Good planning but poorly executed end result | Good planning and good end result although not what had been designed or communicated | Great planning & execution able to achieve what had been designed or communicated |
