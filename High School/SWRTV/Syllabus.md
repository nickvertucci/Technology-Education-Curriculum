### Course Description

SWR TV is a digital media production course that will provide students with the television/video production experience, filmmaking, broadcast journalism and podcasting. In our production studio, students will take part in a series or projects that will build career and college ready skills offering a new perspective into student life on campus and in the community. Segments and programs are to include news programs, documentaries, interviews, sport highlights and podcasting shows. Students will create, develop and complete work using Final Cut Pro and have deliverables be published via Vimeo, Youtube, swrtv.com and throughout the high School on TVs and smart-boards.
