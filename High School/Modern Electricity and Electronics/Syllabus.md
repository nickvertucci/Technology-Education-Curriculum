### Course Description

Intended for a basic course in electricity and electronics. The curriculum is split up into 8 units starting with an introduction to electricity and electronics then ending with hands-on experiences or project based labs dealing with schematic reading and circuit development. Students will also learn about how electricity is produced and also experience small wiring and soldering assignments as well.


### Course Requirements

Particular attention to detail will be emphasized. Students will be required to accumulate skills from the beginning of the course and will be expected to build on their skills with each successive project and/or assignment. Each assignment will be evaluated based on this grading rubric and at times require mastery in order to be completed:

| Category | Weight | 0 points  | 25 points | 50 points | 75 points | 100 points |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Organization | 20% | Unable to find assignments or not routinely saved | Able to demonstrate some organization by backing up files or use of folders | Both drawings and models are identifiable and can be found if needed | All drawings are in a folder and models organized by folders in Google Drive | All drawings are in a folder labeled correctly and models organized by folders in Google Drive labeled correctly |
| Class Participation | 20% | Showed no participation | Limited to no participation | Inconsistent day-to-day participation | Participated only when needed  | Engaged daily and actively participated |
| Effort | 30% | No effort | limited to no effort | Inconsistent day-to-day effort | Showed effort only when needed or routinely directed | Continuous day-to-day effort with or without direction |
| Creativity/Originality | 15% | No creativity, copied designs | Minimal creativity based off past designs | Moderate improvements based off past designs | Complete overhaul of past or found designs | Completely new idea/design |
| Craftsmanship/Skill | 15% | Poor execution, no planning | Moderate end result, able to achieve an outcome | Good planning but poorly executed end result | Good planning and good end result although not what had been designed or communicated | Great planning & execution able to achieve what had been designed or communicated |


### Required materials

Effective storage of projects and organization of materials is critical to student success. In order to aid students the items listed below will be beneficial:

- 1 x folder
- 1 x 3 ring binder with paper OR notebook for notes, sketches and ideation
***Laptops are allowed and encouraged as long as they are utilized towards course work and not a distraction or they will not be permitted in class. All students are provided the G Suite of tools via Google and their school account.***

### Course Category Grading

The overall grading of the course is weighted as indicated below:

| Category | Weight |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Assignments | 62.5% |
| Do Nows | 2.5% |
| Presentations | 7.5% |
| Pretests | 0% |
| Tests | 27.5% |
