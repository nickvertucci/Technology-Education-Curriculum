## Unit 8 | Section 1 |Testing a Capacitor | Day 4-9

### ITEEA Standards
  3-1. The characteristics and scope of technology
  3-2. The core concepts of technology
  5-8. The attributes of Design
  6-11. Apply the design process

### Objectives [SWBATU]
- Classify various electrical components from a schematic in order to complete a circuit in the Classroom
- Indicate particular sets of electrical nodes in order to complete the schematic in the Classroom
- Explain the flow of electricity through the schematic in the classroom in order to diagnose any issues

#### Success Criteria
- A completed circuit with a light that lights and dims out slowly

### Materials
- LED
- Wire
- Breadboard
- Multimeter
- 9v battery
- resistors (various)
- Capacitor

### Resources

### Instructional Outline
- Review previous unit for electrical components
- Go over schematic views and following the path or flow of Electricity
- Strip new wires to proper length as more of the breadboard will be utilized
- Locate and identify fail points that students should be aware of such as battery configuration and polarity of the LED
- Test the capacitor so that the LED slowly dims away
- Fail points should be identified
- Lastly, go over how the breadboard controls electricity in rows and columns

#### Closure

Capacitors act as small electrical batteries that have the ability to store energy. Capacitors provide current sometimes where there needs to be small amounts. A lgiht that slowly dims away shows the capacitor releasing its charge.
