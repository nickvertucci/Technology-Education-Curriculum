# Unit 1 - Introduction & The Design Process

# Design and Drawing For Production

### BIG IDEA

This first unit is specifically put together to get each student off onto the right track. Coming out of Middle School Technology, the Engineering & Design Process is hinted but rarely emphasized. This unit will help create student expectations in order to heavily utilize the Engineering & Design Process in completing drawings and assignments for the entire year.
