# Section 3 - Cabinet Parts 3D Model

This section will be a continuation of Section 2 utilizing SketchUp as a CAD platform. At this time the DDP A102 room cabinet is complete both within SketchUp and to help communicate its size, it has been dimensioned in LayOut.

## Cabinet Parts 3D Model Breakdown

Each company will need to outline their parts that will need to be fabricated. This means providing orthographic views of each part, front, top, right as well as a generated isometric view. Part design will be done solely in SketchUp. Each design will need to be made to scale as a separate file. For each part needing to be designed, it will be 100 points each.

Once all part have been designed in SketchUp and communicated via titleblocks in Layout, Each company will then do a formal presentation selling or marketing their parts to Mr. V.

### Grading Breakdown

Each part that is designed will be graded in two (2) aspects, the SketchUp file design, and the LayOut file design. Each part will be needing 2 files associated with each and will be graded as fifty (50) points each.

Before each part is to be designed, a sketch of the part needs to be presented to Mr.V and explained what function it will serve in cabinet organization.

#### SketchUp Grading

| Criteria  | Grade |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| File name needs to be DDP-LASTNAME-LASTNAME-[Part Name]  | 10 points  |
| Mark approved for design by Mr.V  | 10 points  |
| Designed in SketchUp using the architecture template FEET/INCHES  | 10 points  |
| Part completed when compared to rough sketch  | 20 points  |

#### LayOut Grading

| Criteria  | Grade |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| File name needs to be DDP-LASTNAME-LASTNAME-[Part Name]  | 10 points  |
| Cover page showing Isometric scene of part  | 10 points  |
| Information page outlining important information of what the part is used for and how it is to be installed  | 10 points  |
| Orthographic page showing a front, top, right and isometric view of the part  | 10 points  |
| Each view is dimensioned using the architectural style to communicate size  | 5 points  |
| Overall neatness and organization of the orthographic page, the views, and dimensions  | 5 points  |

#### Presentation Grading

| Criteria  | Grade |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Google presentation fielname DDP-Company Name-Cabinet Presentation  | 10 points  |
| 1 slide explaining the purpose of the project  | 10 points  |
