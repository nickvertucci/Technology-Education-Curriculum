### Creating Your Design Brief

A Design brief is a document for a design project developed by a person or team (the 'designer' or 'design team') in consultation with the 'client'. They outline the **deliverables** and scope of the project including any products or works (function and aesthetics), timing and budget. They can be used for many projects including those in the fields of architecture, interior design and industrial design. Design briefs are also used to evaluate the effectiveness of a design after it has been produced and during the creation process to keep the project on track and on budget. Some firms rely on them more than others but there is a move towards greater accountability in the design process and thus many people find them most useful.
