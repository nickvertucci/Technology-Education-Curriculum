# Unit 10 - Section 1 - Puzzle Cube Design

This unit will go into our DDP puzzle cube design unit where students will define the problem statement, design via SketchUp and Technical drawing techniques a puzzle cube of 1x1x1 blocks and later produce the prototype of their puzzle via 3D printing. The exact puzzle piece will be a 3x3x3 puzzle piece when completed.

## Puzzle Cube Design Breakdown

Each student will design a puzzle cube of their own that forms a 3x3x3 cube when complete. Each configuration of the block cannot contain more then 6 1x1x1 cubes. All the pieces will need to interlock and be of different color choices as well. Each piece will be sketched and later 3D modeled individually by SketchUp to show interlocking completion.

### Evaluation

Each section will be graded based on the following criteria:

| Category | Weight | 0 points  | 25 points | 50 points | 75 points | 100 points |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Organization | 20% | Unable to find assignments or not routinely saved | Able to demonstrate some organization by backing up files or use of folders | Both drawings and models are identifiable and can be found if needed | All drawings are in a folder and models organized by folders in Google Drive | All drawings are in a folder labeled correctly and models organized by folders in Google Drive labeled correctly |
| Class Participation | 20% | Showed no participation | Limited to no participation | Inconsistent day-to-day participation | Participated only when needed  | Engaged daily and actively participated |
| Effort | 30% | No effort | limited to no effort | Inconsistent day-to-day effort | Showed effort only when needed or routinely directed | Continuous day-to-day effort with or without direction |
| Creativity/Originality | 15% | No creativity, copied designs | Minimal creativity based off past designs | Moderate improvements based off past designs | Complete overhaul of past or found designs | Completely new idea/design |
| Craftsmanship/Skill | 15% | Poor execution, no planning | Moderate end result, able to achieve an outcome | Good planning but poorly executed end result | Good planning and good end result although not what had been designed or communicated | Great planning & execution able to achieve what had been designed or communicated |
