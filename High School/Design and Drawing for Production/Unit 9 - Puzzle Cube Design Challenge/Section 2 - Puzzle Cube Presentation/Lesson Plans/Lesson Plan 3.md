# Lesson Plan

# Design and Draw for Production

## Unit 10 | Section 1 | Puzzle Cube Design | Day 6

### ITEEA Standards
  5-8. Attributes of design
  5-9. Engineering designs
  5-10. The role of troubleshooting, research and development, invention and innovation, and experimentation in problem solving

### Objectives [SWBATU]

- Create an finalized workable cube based on previous design parts

### Materials
- Laptops/computer lab access
- Drafting tools and materials
- 3D printer + filament

### Resources

- Unit 10 - Section 1 - Handout 2
- Unit 10 - Section 1 - Handout 3

### Instructional Outline

- Review design and engineering process
- Discuss the overall project and what we will be doing along with graded assignments
  - Creating a 3D puzzle cube made of plastic via our 3D printer
  - Each piece will need to be interlocking
  - Technical drawings to start indicating ideas and understanding
  - Approval of technical drawings in order to move into CAD of pieces
  - 3D model and Layout of each piece and combined puzzle piece
- Review the isometric drawing paper and how each part is needed
- Explain how 30 part concept designs are needed to be communicated
