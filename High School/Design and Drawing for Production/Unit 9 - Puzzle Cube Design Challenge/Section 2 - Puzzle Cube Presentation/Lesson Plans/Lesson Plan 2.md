# Lesson Plan

# Design and Draw for Production

## Unit 10 | Section 1 | Puzzle Cube Design | Day 3-5

### ITEEA Standards
  5-8. Attributes of design
  5-9. Engineering designs
  5-10. The role of troubleshooting, research and development, invention and innovation, and experimentation in problem solving

### Objectives [SWBATU]

- Design puzzle parts according to the proper criteria and constraints.
- Requirements of a design, such as criteria, constraints, and efficiency, sometimes compete with each other.
- The design process includes defining a problem, brainstorming, researching and generating ideas, identifying criteria and specifying constraints, exploring possibilities, selecting an approach, developing a design proposal, making a model or prototype, testing and evaluating the design using specifications, refining the design, creating or making it, and communicating processes and results.

### Materials
- Laptops/computer lab access
- Drafting tools and materials
- 3D printer + filament

### Resources

- Unit 10 - Section 1 - Handout 2
- Unit 10 - Section 1 - Handout 3

### Instructional Outline

- Review design and engineering process
- Discuss the overall project and what we will be doing along with graded assignments
  - Creating a 3D puzzle cube made of plastic via our 3D printer
  - Each piece will need to be interlocking
  - Technical drawings to start indicating ideas and understanding
  - Approval of technical drawings in order to move into CAD of pieces
  - 3D model and Layout of each piece and combined puzzle piece
- Emphasize puzzle piece constraints and Criteria
- Design 20 individual parts via TinkerCAD or SketchUp to be submitted via Google Classroom

### Assignment / Activities

| Assignment  | Grade |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Rough sketch brainstorm designs (20 individual pieces)  | 100 points  |
