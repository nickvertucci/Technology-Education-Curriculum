# Lesson Plan

# Design and Draw for Production

## Unit 10 | Section 1 | Puzzle Cube Design | Day 9-10

### ITEEA Standards
  5-8. Attributes of design
  5-9. Engineering designs
  5-10. The role of troubleshooting, research and development, invention and innovation, and experimentation in problem solving
  6-11. Apply the design process

### Objectives [SWBATU]

- Summarize their designs by means of testing their puzzle cube designs through different variables
- Create a baseline assessment of how easy or hard their puzzle cubes are based on different testing variables

### Materials
- Laptops/computer lab access
- Drafting tools and materials
- 3D printer + filament

### Resources

- Finalized puzzle cube

### Instructional Outline

- Provide the testing spreadsheet or allow students to fabricate their own
- Students can approach students in class to time completion results of their puzzle cubes
- Students are then allowed to also take the testing outside of class if needed to compute larger data sets
