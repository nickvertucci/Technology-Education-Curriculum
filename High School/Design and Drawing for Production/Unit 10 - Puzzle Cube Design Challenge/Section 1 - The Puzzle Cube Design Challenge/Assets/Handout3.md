### Puzzle Cube Rough Sketch Design Requirements
These are the design requirements as part of the first step of the design process in defining our problem.

- No more then 3 cubes in any direction
- Avoid flat pieces
- 3-6 cubes  per collection / 27 cubes total
- 5 collections
- No repeated shapes
- No edge joints
- Each part should be numbered for puzzle completion
- The block needs to be a standard dimensions of 2.25" (L) x 2.25" (W) x 2.25" (H)
- Each individual block needs to be a standard dimension of .75" (L) x .75" (W) x .75" (H)
- Submit digital file to the classroom assignment from TinkerCAD or SketchUp
- It can be a single file with all 20 parts or 20 individual files each with a single part
