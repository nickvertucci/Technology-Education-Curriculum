# Unit 0 - Safety

# World of Technology (FoT)

### BIG IDEA

Students will learn the importance of documenting their daily work using an Engineering Design Journal via Google Classroom.

Knowledge of basic technology and engineering skills and classroom routines will be essential for student success in the First Five Days Learning Cycle. The 21st century skills of collaboration and problem solving are essential for engineering solutions of the future. Preliminary and Primary Challenges of the Advanced Design Applications course. The Engineering Design Process is an iterative method that people use to solve problems.

You only get one chance to make a first impression! Students will collaborate with peers to internalize and implement the Engineering Design Process to design, construct, test, modify, and reflect on ways to solve a problem.

Use the *First Five Days* to excite and engage students in the importance of Technology in their lives moving forward on a global scale. The primary focus is to briefly expose students to the importance of working collaboratively to document the overriding steps of the Engineering Design Process to solve a problem. Furthermore, students will be exposed to the course blueprint to formulate a mental road map of topics to be covered during the course.

### Objectives

SWBAT:

- Collaborate with others to effectively solve a problem.
- Design, construct, test, and modify their design solutions to satisfy a problem.
- Apply the steps in the simplified engineering design process to design a solution to a problem.
- Communicate effectively and engage in conversations required to master the engineering design process.
- Use an engineering design journal (EDJ) to document the process used to solve engineering problems.
- Learn to apply brainstorming techniques within the engineering design process as a way to document a variety of solutions to a proposed problem.

### Unit Evaluation

| Category | Weight | 0 points  | 25 points | 50 points | 75 points | 100 points |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Organization | 20% | Unable to find assignments or not routinely saved | Able to demonstrate some organization by backing up files or use of folders | Both drawings and models are identifiable and can be found if needed | All drawings are in a folder and models organized by folders in Google Drive | All drawings are in a folder labeled correctly and models organized by folders in Google Drive labeled correctly |
| Class Participation | 20% | Showed no participation | Limited to no participation | Inconsistent day-to-day participation | Participated only when needed  | Engaged daily and actively participated |
| Effort | 30% | No effort | limited to no effort | Inconsistent day-to-day effort | Showed effort only when needed or routinely directed | Continuous day-to-day effort with or without direction |
| Creativity/Originality | 15% | No creativity, copied designs | Minimal creativity based off past designs | Moderate improvements based off past designs | Complete overhaul of past or found designs | Completely new idea/design |
| Craftsmanship/Skill | 15% | Poor execution, no planning | Moderate end result, able to achieve an outcome | Good planning but poorly executed end result | Good planning and good end result although not what had been designed or communicated | Great planning & execution able to achieve what had been designed or communicated |
