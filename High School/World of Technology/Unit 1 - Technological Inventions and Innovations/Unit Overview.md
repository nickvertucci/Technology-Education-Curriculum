# World Of Technology

### BIG IDEA

Inventions and Innovations are a result of evolutionary technological development and systematic research
and development.

Unit 1, Technological Inventions and Innovations, analyzes the historical significance of technological advancements.
It examines the profound effects of technology on the course of history and the ways in which it continues to shape
our future. The unit also explores how the development and use of technology is influenced by cultural, social,
political, economic, and environmental factors. Additionally, this unit examines how technological inventions and
innovations are the results of an evolutionary process and a series of refinements. These refinements lead to new
and improved technological products, as well as new technological processes. As you will see throughout this unit,
technological inventions and innovations are the results of in-depth research and development and the problem solving
approach used in engineering.
