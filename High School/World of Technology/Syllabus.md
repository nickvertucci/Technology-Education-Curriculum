### Course Description

World of Technology prepares students to understand pre-engineering concepts that focus on critical thinking and problem-solving. Group and individual activities engage students in creating ideas, developing innovations, and engineering practical solutions. Technology content, resources, and laboratory/classroom activities apply student applications of science, mathematics, and other school subjects in authentic situations.

The term “technological literacy” refers to one's ability to use, manage, evaluate, and understand technology. In order to be a technologically literate citizen, a person should understand what technology is, how it works, how it shapes society, and in turn how society shapes it. This course focuses on the three dimensions of technological literacy—knowledge, ways of thinking and acting, and capabilities—with the goal of students developing the characteristics of technologically literate citizens. It employs teaching/learning strategies that enable students to explore and deepen their understanding of “big ideas” regarding technology and makes use of a variety of assessment instruments to reveal the extent of understanding.

Students develop an understanding of engineering design, the formal process that transforms ideas into products or systems of the designed world. They select and use manufacturing technologies and understand that modern manufacturing technologies produce quality goods at low prices, enhancing the quality of life for many people. Students select and use construction technologies and recognize that cultural norms, environmental conditions, and the requirements of enterprises and institutions impact the design of structures. Opportunities are provided that enable students to select and use energy and power technologies and to explore the processing and controlling of the energy resources that have been important in the development of contemporary technology. Opportunities are provided that enable students to gain insights into the use of telemedicine and other medical technologies. They become familiar with information and communication technologies and their role in the use of other technologies. The course concludes with the synthesizing of major ideas through an understanding of the impacts the use of technology has on society and the environment.

### Course Requirements

Students develop an understanding of the influence of technology on history by exploring how people of all times and places have increased their capability by using their unique skills to innovate, improvise, and invent. They gain an understanding of technological innovation and the fact that it often results when ideas, knowledge, or skills are shared within a technology, among technologies, or across other fields of study. Each assignment will be evaluated based on this grading rubric and at times require mastery in order to be completed:

| Category | Weight | 0 points  | 25 points | 50 points | 75 points | 100 points |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Organization | 5% | Unable to find assignments or not routinely saved | Able to demonstrate some organization by backing up files or use of folders | Both drawings and models are identifiable and can be found if needed | All drawings are in a folder and models organized by folders in Google Drive | All drawings are in a folder labeled correctly and models organized by folders in Google Drive labeled correctly |
| Class Participation | 5% | Showed no participation | Limited to no participation | Inconsistent day-to-day participation | Participated only when needed  | Engaged daily and actively participated |
| Effort | 10% | No effort | limited to no effort | Inconsistent day-to-day effort | Showed effort only when needed or routinely directed | Continuous day-to-day effort with or without direction |
| Creativity/Originality | 10% | No creativity, copied designs | Minimal creativity based off past designs | Moderate improvements based off past designs | Complete overhaul of past or found designs | Completely new idea/design |
| Craftsmanship/Skill | 70% | Poor execution, no planning | Moderate end result, able to achieve an outcome | Good planning but poorly executed end result | Good planning and good end result although not what had been designed or communicated | Great planning & execution able to achieve what had been designed or communicated |

### Required materials

DDP is a drafting and production course. Effective storage of projects and organization of materials is critical to student success. In order to aid students the items listed below will be beneficial:

- 1 x folder
- 1 x Bound Notebook for **Engineering Journal**
    - The notebook must be bound and no pages can be added or removed. Students will record research, experimental data and observations, calculations, mentor contacts, relevant vocabulary, and ideas for future research within the notebook. You will receive a rubric outlining the notebook requirements to reference throughout the course.

***Laptops are allowed and encouraged as long as they are utilized towards course work and not a distraction or they will not be permitted in class. All students are provided the G Suite of tools via Google and their school account.***
