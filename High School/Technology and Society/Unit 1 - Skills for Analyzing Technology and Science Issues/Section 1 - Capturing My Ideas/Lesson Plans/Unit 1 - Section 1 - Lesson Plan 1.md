### Objectives

Select and purchase an Idea Notebook that “calls to you,” one that you want to carry and put things in.

The life of a concerned technologist, inventor, designer, and engineer requires living in two worlds. The first world is the external or physical world, which includes the human-built world. It is made up of the things we can touch, see, hear, or taste and contains the products of human imagination. The second world is hidden; it is the internal world—our thoughts and daydreams, ideas, calculations, and research. It is where ideas are born and opinions are nourished.

All technologies go through at least two acts of creation. The first act is in the imagination, where a problem or opportunity is recognized and we start to mentally design what the solution might look like. The second act of creation is the transformation of intangible ideas into tangible products or artifacts. It is also where opinions, biases, and judgments are formed.

For inventors, the idea for novel solutions and questions to consider regarding a problem or insights into a dilemma can occur at any time. It is important to have a place to record these thoughts for later use. For you, this place is the Idea Notebook. The Idea Notebook is a place for designers to save their reflections, ramblings, thoughts, sketches, and even scraps of paper torn from magazines. The notebook is a useful tool if you choose to write in it, if you choose to use it as a thinking and memory tool, if you choose to go back over what you have written. The purpose of the Idea Notebook is to provide a place to practice writing down thoughts, findings, and ideas, and reflecting on the issues and impacts associated with the creation and advancement of technology. Writing words on paper before they are lost is an important skill that will provide immediate academic improvement and long-term professional success. We should learn to write so that we can further explore the ideas later. Notes in our notebooks should be things we want to remember. When writing about important issues, always: define the issue clearly; collect as much information as you can; analyze the important aspects of the issue; and, propose a solution to the problem.

The form of the notebook is important to the degree that it is easy to carry around, easy to write in, helps organize your thoughts, and most importantly, encourages you to take the time to write in it. The sections in the Idea Notebook are arbitrary and should help organize your thinking within the notebook.

### Assignment / Activities

Select and purchase an Idea Notebook using the following questions to guide your selection.
•	Is it easily portable?
•	Does the size of the page make it easy to write and sketch?
•	Is there a way you can store notes or handouts in it?
•	Do you need/want to add or take out pages in a section you have already completed?
•	Can you personalize it?
•	Can you create sections in it?
•	When you fill it up, is it inexpensively replaced?

Personalize the notebook and add your name and contact information in case you should leave it somewhere.

Divide your notebook into sections where you can record and easily find your thoughts. You are not limited to these sections, nor do you need to have all of them. The basic idea is to provide a structured place where you can record your thoughts as they occur and easily find them later.
•	Course assignments including lectures, movies, readings, etc.
•	Problems you found interesting but were not able to explore at the moment.
•	Phrases, quotes, words, and thoughts of others.
•	Random ideas, thoughts, reflections that you don’t want to forget.
•	Technological irritations.
•	Perplexities – Why is it this way?
•	Things that make you say, “Hmmm?”

For your first entry, write in your Idea Notebook for 10 minutes your ideas on the following topic:
Reflect and write on the following topic: Leonardo da Vinci said, “Feathers will raise men, as they do birds towards heaven.” (Hint: He was referring to writing, not flying, and feathers refer to a writing instrument.)

### Added Notes

Recommendations
- Number the pages of your notebook.
- Leave several pages blank in the front of the notebook so you can insert a table of contents for easy entry location.
- Devise a method for marking sections in the Idea Notebook (e.g. tabs, adhesive notes, paper clips, etc). The first page of a section should be moveable to allow for varying the length of the section. Not all sections need to have the same number of pages.
- When you make an error, don’t erase, scribble out, or white-out the error. Simply draw a single line through the word, sentence, or entry and continue writing.
- Never tear out pages of your Idea Notebook.
- When you start new entries, indicate the date, time, and location of the entry.
- Although you should try to use the correct spelling and grammar in the Idea Notebook, it is more important to get your ideas down. The Idea Notebook is not your first or final draft document.
