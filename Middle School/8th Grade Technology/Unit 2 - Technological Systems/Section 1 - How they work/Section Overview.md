# Unit [1] - Section [1] - Technological Systems and How They Work

# 8th Grade Technology

### BIG Idea

This course will investigate technological systems through their function, design, development, interaction and maintenance. Systems included in this exploration include communications, construction, manufacturing, bio-medical and power energy.

Technological Systems are designed and developed following specific criteria.

Unit 1 prepares students to understand and evaluate the design and development of technological systems.

### Objectives

SWBAT:

- Define a system as "open" or "closed"
- Identify requirements placed on a system
- Interpret the components of the systems model: input, processes, output, and feedback
- Understand and explain the relationship between components in a technological system
- Compare and contrast the process of invention versus the process of innovation
- Explain how the development and construction of technological systems have changed over time, due to increased control capabilities.
- Design a product, system or environment that could not be produced without technology.
