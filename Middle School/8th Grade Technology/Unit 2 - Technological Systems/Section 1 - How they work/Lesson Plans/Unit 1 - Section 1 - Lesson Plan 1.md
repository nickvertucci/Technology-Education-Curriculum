# Daily Lesson Plan

# Technological Systems

## Unit [1] | Section [1] | [Development of Technological Systems] | Day [1-6]

### Objectives

Technological Systems are developed to meet specific criteria and must be able to function to complete the systems loop.

This lesson enables students to learn that technological systems are built from multiple components to meet specific criteria. Systems are "open" or "closed" and include: input, processes, output, and feedback. The relationship between components in a system determine the function of the system.

- Define a system as "open" or "closed"
- Identify requirements placed on a system
- Interpret the components of the systems model: input, processes, output, and feedback
- Understand and explain the relationship between components in a technological system
- Contribute to a group endeavor by offering useful ideas, supporting the efforts of others, and focusing on the task.
- Work safely and accurately with a variety of tools, machines, and materials.
- Actively participate in group discussions, ideation exercises, and debates.

### Instructional Outline

Engagement
The teacher lists five different common items or tasks on the board, such as making a phone call, mailing a letter or preparing to walk a dog. Students are introduced to the concept of systems through the investigation and discussion of what components make up a system and describing systems in their daily lives.
Using their Engineering Design Journals, students write down the steps that they consider important in completing the selected task from the list.
Other potential steps that are part of the process such as charging or plugging in the phone are discussed as requirements or constraints on the system.
Once the steps have been listed, the class will discuss the steps needed to complete these tasks, and the teacher will introduce systems terminology, including: input, output, process, feedback and open and closed systems.
In their engineering design journals, students are asked to create a chart or diagram of the system that was previously described.

Exploration

The teacher provides students with a visual description of a specific system, and students work in pairs to identify components and the purpose of the system.
Using their engineering design journals, students document possible system purposes and identify component types with specific examples.
Working with their partner, students identify the relationships between components and the restraints on the function of the system.
In their engineering design journals, students describe the steps that make up the process from the visual description.

Explanation

The teacher, involving students in the following discussions as they contribute their experiences from the Engagement and Exploration activities along with any prior knowledge they may have about the subject:

As a class, students will discuss requirements placed on systems as constraints in their design. Discussion will include potential sources of requirements, such as social, economic, political, ethical and aesthetic concerns.
Students are divided into Engineering Design Teams to discuss and brainstorm possible tasks or processes to accomplish with a system that they will design. Tasks should be simple, with no more than 5 components and 5 processes, and may include human interaction.
Once each team has a list of possible tasks, the class will discuss ideas together to make the final selection for each team.
Potential processes, materials and the selected task to be completed by each team's system should be documented in the Engineering Design Journal.
In preparing to construct a model of their system, students will solve real-life math problems with an emphasis on geometric shapes, ratios and fractional measurement.

Extension

Working in engineering design teams, students develop a diagram or demonstration of a system to accomplish a specific goal or process.
Using the system goal selected by the team in the Explanation activity, students develop a system to complete that task, using appropriate measurement, angles, area, surface area and volume of system components.
Documentation of the design process including system sketches, processes and a diagram or demonstration are included in the Engineering Design Journal.
Documentation of system components, the role that they play within the system and the system type are included in the presentation and Engineering Design Journal.
Teams will present the system with a diagram or demonstration of the system to the class.

Enrichment

Using the designed systems, engineering design teams will build a model of the completed system, and relate it to systems developed by other design teams.

Evaluation

Students' knowledge, skills, and attitudes are assessed using Engineering Design Journals, Constructed Response items, Performance Rubrics, End of lesson quiz, and an End of unit quiz.
