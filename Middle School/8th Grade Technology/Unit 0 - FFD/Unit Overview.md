### Course Description

Ever tried to design something new or draw up an idea you wanted to share with your
friends and wondered how you could communicate your idea? Have you wondered how
someone designed that new gadget or sleek new smartphone? Then this course is for you. This
introductory problem-solving course covers six concept areas in technical drawing required to
produce quality mechanical drawings and actual production of their design. The assignments
begin with basic drafting techniques, progress to some design problems, and illustrations that
culminate with a model. This “hands on” method of instruction presents an effective design
solution for student understanding. Students will use the tools of the draftsperson and the
required woodworking equipment to complete these projects. The student receives instruction to
help them gain competence in two and three view, section and isometric drawings. In addition,
you will use SketchUp, a 3D design software package from Google, to help you design solutions
to different projects.
