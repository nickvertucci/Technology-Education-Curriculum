# Unit 9 - Bloxels

# 8th Grade Technology

### BIG IDEA

Bloxels leverages student enthusiasm for video games to create an environment where learning is fun, interactive, and informative. Bloxels employs elements of an animated story â€“ character, environment, and trials, combining them into a video game to design, code, play, share, and collaborate alongside peers. The platform is a great introduction to high-tech environments that will surround them in the workplace later on in life.

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
- Computational thinking
- Thinking critically and making judgements.
- Solving complex, multi-disciplinary, open-ended problems.
- Creativity and entrepreneurial thinking.
- Communicating and collaborating.
- Making innovative use of knowledge, information and opportunities.

### Objectives

SWBAT:

- Integrate and evaluate content presented in diverse media and formats, including visually and quantitatively, as well as in words.
- Generate a number or shape pattern that follows a given rule. Identify apparent features of the pattern that were not explicit in the rule itself. For example, given the rule "Add 3" and the starting number 1, generate terms in the resulting sequence and observe that the terms appear to alternate between odd and even numbers. Explain informally why the numbers will continue to alternate in this way.
- Explain what a point (x, y) on the graph of a proportional relationship means in terms of the situation, with special attention to the points (0, 0) and (1, r) where r is the unit rate.
- Evaluate competing design solutions using a systematic process to determine how well they meet the criteria and constraints of the problem.
